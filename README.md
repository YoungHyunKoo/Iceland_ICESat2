# Hofsj-kull mass balance ICESat2
Linked to the manuscript submitted to GRL "Seasonal mass balance of Hofsjökull ice cap, Iceland, estimated from repeat ICESat-2 satellite altimetry."
- ICESat-2 data processing with SlideRule
- Read DEM data and compare with ICESat-2
- Conduct hypsometric interpolation to ICESat-2 along-track repeat elevation measurements
- Convert ICESat-2 elevation change into glacier-wide mass balance
- Compare with in-situ mass balance measurements
